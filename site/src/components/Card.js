Soon, she garnered the title of \"the one-person bomb squad\", as her exceptional talent in bomb disposal was \"like one person doing the work of an entire squad\" according to the local paper. She's periodically called in to help with local bomb scares despite being a mere high schooler. Law enforcement is often criticized for relying on some kid to do their job for them, but nobody can deny that she gets results and saves lives, and that we can all feel safer with her around." },

Accusations of nepotism have ever plagued the young Smith, but his parents categorically deny having any hand in his success, stating that his genius is entirely his own. In the present day, given that he keeps an intensely private life and his tax records are not public, one can only speculate as to the total worth of his assets. One thing's for certain, though: his ability to predict market trends is uncanny, and his outrageous dividends speak for themselves." },

If you look far enough back, you can find reports of the \"Feral 8 Year Old Spotted in Venezuela\". When the police picked up the unidentified girl, she claimed she was living in the wild by choice, and had been since she was six years old. She vanished from the station the next morning. How she moves between such distant places seemingly without money, and how she learned to survive alone in the wilderness so young is unknown. Her desire to not stay in one place even led to her refusing to attend Hope's Peak in person. At least she doesn't seem feral anymore… mostly." },

They're also quite the recluse, publishing all work online and giving interviews via text channels or extremely poorly lit video, so nobody has actually seen their face. Convincing them to go to Hope's Peak, even remotely, was quite the undertaking." },

Who else gets to gather all of the top minds of a generation into an auditorium for a cheaply-produced safety-themed puppet show? Her love for the craft is only outweighed by her general crotchety disposition. Even if you haven't seen her scowling in the halls, you've probably received an accidental email from her at some point." },

Through the site and its related social media are hundreds of ghostly photographs taken from locations across the United States, with appearances having such variety as an apparent floating orb, a translucent woman in historical dress, or a strange blur that could easily just be lens flare. More notable than the images themselves are the intricate notes left underneath detailing the exact conditions they were taken under - time, date, weather condition, their relative position in the film reel, ambient light… the list goes on, sometimes including the claimed ghost's age and history. Blakeley's work has been mistaken for an obscure promotional campaign in the past, but the ghost logger says the project is solely him laying out the facts for those who don't believe the dead still walk among us." },

Yi-seul's contributions and personal projects can be found on various platforms where he tends to feature video demonstrations of limb enhancers and other hybrid human-controlled mechanisms right next to random memes and pictures of social events. It seems to most that he doesn't mind blending his personal and professional lives, and folks are intrigued on what new technological marvels will arrive out of such a bright mind." },

Isaak is most prominently known for the one piece of music released under his name, Symphonie der leisen Streicher (Symphony of Silent Strings), a musical score presented in the form of a novel. The work received mixed reviews upon its release, with critics most frequently disputing its status as a literary piece due to the absence of any narration or dialogue. The work began to gain notoriety for the consistency with which readers could interpret its \"plot,\" and as such the novel has since received international acclaim for thoroughly embodying its underlying message of \"Music is a language.\"" },

His talent, personal history, and mission, exactly, is extremely ambiguous, but it likely has to do with the mad doctor's theories of life outside of Earth. He is currently on parole." },

Most of her past before becoming acquainted with Rerinison is unknown, though it's been noted that V is completely mute. Taken in by the charming young man at age eight, V has continuously impressed and become something of a wonder child in the eyes of the American public. Velocity is to thank for such helpful technologies such as: Velocity Karen: a triangle-shaped AI assistant that you can place in your home, which most definitely won't be listening into every conversation you have. Velocity Go!: an online worldwide catalog that allows you to buy and shop just about anything from trusted companies and sellers. They treat their warehouse workers very well, I hear! Velocity Air Tag: a handy-dandy chip that you can implant into your devices, car keys, and just about anything else so that you can track it on the Velocity Air Tag App! Just don't implant it into people, you crazy kids! That would be called stalking, and despite it being both incredibly easy and possible, it's also very wrong!

Through increasingly poor management, horrible PR, human rights violations and several breakdowns, the company fell into ruin, and its CEO, the eponymous Midas himself - Simon - returned to Hope's Peak Academy to fall into obscurity, his impact on the digital industry remaining the only proof that he was ever alive." },

Despite this, she's not once been spotted on campus nor has she been known to socialize with other students at the school, it's even rumored that she may have the poorest academic discipline the school has ever seen. Anyone in any relevant fields would've never heard her name, if anything she seems like a bit of a delinquent, but it looks that the tensions between her and Hope's Peak Academy are high, at least so far as her not seeming to enjoy her time there in the slightest." },

She's among the top of her class in regards to grades, is the captain of her school's debate team, and puts in lots of volunteer hours. The only strange thing about her is that she ends up having to take a lot of medical days off, the specifics of why something she refrains from disclosing. If you asked people at her school what they think of her, they'd say she's pretty sweet, but you have to make an effort to reach out to her if you want to be her friend." }
